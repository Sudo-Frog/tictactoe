A game of tictactoe.
Language: Java
Environment: VisualStudioCode

Traditionally, TicTacToe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid, one with 'X's and the other with 'O's. A player wins when they mark all three spaces of a row, column, or diagonal of the grid, whereupon they traditionally draw a line through those three marks to indicate the win. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

The original project was created utilizing Java AWT -Abstract Window Toolkit- (import java.awt.*;), a set of Java APIs for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that are cross-platform. AWT uses native components from the underlying operating system to build GUIs, which helps preserve the native look and feel of each platform. The Fdemo class extends Frame, from the AWT Library.
