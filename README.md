A game of tictactoe.

Traditionally, TicTacToe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid, one with 'X's and the other with 'O's. A player wins when they mark all three spaces of a row, column, or diagonal of the grid, whereupon they traditionally draw a line through those three marks to indicate the win. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
